What is Irrigation:

Irrigation is an optimization protocol built on top of credit market generating stablecoin issuers.
Irrigation protocol consists of 6 intertwined sectors that together coalesce into a financial system.
The smart contracts of these facets can be found in this repository, and the reader will find further technical details in the specific branches.

Irrigation is experimental and a work in progress; use at your own risk.
As a second layer protocol, Irrigation inherits risk from the underlying Defi projects on which it is built. 
An example of underlying protocol risks can be found in protocol documentation such as the following: https://qnl6fd2lgilpxmjvd43sgzkkhhwvvog4nwgekmd27eriogqrkf4a.arweave.net/g1fij0syFvuxNR83I2VKOe1auNxtjEUwevkihxoRUXg

In light of the unforseeable nature of all risks in decentralized finance, the founding developers have taken care to limit the relative impact to Irrigation in case any of the underlying credit protocols fails.

Welcome, and may fortune smile upon you.
